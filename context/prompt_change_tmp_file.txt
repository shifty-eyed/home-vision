I am thinking of changing @app/stream_processor.py logic to make the ffmpeg to always write current stream to the file in tmp directory with file name 
suffexed with date time. and when a segment finished and ffmped start to write to new file and logs that in stderr, 
the stderr watching thread detects it and adds to the queue of files to move.

1. let's make a new thread in StreamProcessor class called monitor, similar to _processing_loop.
add file_queue[str] to the StreamProcessor.
monitor loop will just check in the loop if file queue is not empty - it runs the FileManager.move

2. add to config the scratch dir and use it as output dir for ffmpeg output

3. in std err detect lines like 
[segment @ 0x56dcc8473c40] Opening '/home/rrr/video-out/2025_12_10/cam1-front/cam1-front_14_30_45.mp4' for writing
parse file name and add the a specific queue, each process wrapper should have property - currrent file. 
when current file changes the previous file get's sent to file_queue

4. make new class in separate py file a FileManager and there we place a move logic. it will have method Move. accepting the queue
checks the queue and move the file to target folder, creating subfolders if needed.
