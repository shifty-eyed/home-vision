I am thinking of changing @app/stream_processor.py logic to make the ffmpeg to always write current stream to the file in tmp directory with known file name 
suffexed with date time. and when segment finished and ffmped start to write to new file the watching thread detects it and moved the finished file to target directory.  
can writing to the same dir harm SSD hard drive ? if not lt's plan the change
